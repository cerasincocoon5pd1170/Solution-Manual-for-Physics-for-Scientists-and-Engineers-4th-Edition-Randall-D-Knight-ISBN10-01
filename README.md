### Product Details:


* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0133942651
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0133942651
  * * Author: Randall D. Knight
   
* For the Fourth Edition ofPhysics for Scientists and Engineers, Knight continues to build on strong research-based foundations with fine-tuned and streamlined content, hallmark features, and an even more robust MasteringPhysics program, taking student learning to a new level. By extending problem-solving guidance to include a greater emphasis on modeling and significantly revised and more challenging problem sets, students gain confidence and skills in problem solving. A modified Table of Contents and the addition of advanced topics now accommodate different teaching preferences and course structures.
